# FiniteVarietiesDB.jl

This project aims to provide a free and accessible database for varities over finite fields.
This project makes critical use of Oscar.jl (the Open Source Computer Algebra Research system) as a 
foundation for mathematical algorithms and infrastructure and of DuckDB as a foundation for its database
functionality.

## Functionality

- Currently, this project provides functionality for computing a set of class representatives for equivalence classes of hypersurfaces in projective space over a finite field under projective equivalence.
